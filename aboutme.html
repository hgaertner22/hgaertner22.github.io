            <p>Hi! My name is Hannah, and I'm a soon-to-be graduate of Northwestern University. During my four years at Northwestern (and one before that at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign (#andtransfers) ) I've pursued a Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering--featuring a second major in Classics, concentration Latin--and a Master of Science in Computer Science. Along the way I picked up the sport of ultimate and joined GungHo, Northwestern's club women's ultimate team. Off the field and out of the classroom I enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle (although get beyond 3000 pieces and you've lost me) or game of Bananagrams.</p>
            <p>Found on this site are a couple chosen pieces from my various Latin courses. Enjoy!</p>
