            <p>The women of Rome faced a double standard, an impossible line to walk. Told to admire the revered female emblem of the city, Roma, fierce warrior and proud bestower of virtue, while facing disgrace should they actually act along her principles. Rome actively vilifies mortal women who break the mold of the quiet moral wife or Vestal Virgin yet continues to promote this valiant vision among their men and divinities (female and male). Yet despite the disgrace, it is the women who adhere to Roma's values and break the then-modern mold who go down in history, who receive the monuments, whose names are still known today, despite their "faults".</p>
