            <p>Best known in modern day for allegedly playing the fiddle as he watched Rome burn, during his rule Nero (emperor 54-68 CE) desperately sought to be known as the second coming of Apollo, mimicking the god in every way he could. His teacher, the great Seneca, saw such megalomaniacal tendencies in him early, and did his best to steer his pupil away from these (alas, he was unsuccessful). Seneca's satire, <i>The Apocolocyntosis</i> holds both a surface and deeper meaning to it, the former to humiliate his former banisher Claudius and the latter to demonstrate to Nero that his divine obsession will not lead him where he wants to go.</p>
